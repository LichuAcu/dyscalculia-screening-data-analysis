# Screening data analysis

Dyscalculia Screener is free software to easily detect precursors of dyscalculia. It aims to solve the problem that most children with dyscalculia are never diagnosed and therefore go untreatedent. It has been built together with an international team of cognitive neuroscientists from the University of Buenos Aires, University College London, University College Dublin and the University of Melbourne.

This is the analysis of the data we obtained in our first pilot study, carried out with a hundred students from a school in Buenos Aires, Argentina.
